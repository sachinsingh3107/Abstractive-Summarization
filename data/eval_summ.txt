My Second Favorite Floyd album (after "The Wall")
Floyd's "High-Waters Mark"
I only wish there was more material.
Oh yes...
Floyd's Overlooked Classic
The Floyd flying high yet again - like the pig on the cover!
"You better watch out! They may be dogs about...!"
"Dark Side of the Moon" was a great album, and I like to listen to it ...
Sinister, Dark and Contemplative
Animals
FOR CHRISTS SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A Lost Masterpiece
Waters' mind takes flight with Gilmour guitar work.
Dragged Down By The Stone
A timeless classic, but...
The last consistent Floyd album
CLASSIC PINK FLOYD!!!!
A masterpiece. George Orwell would approve.
Three Journeys + Two Bookends = One Masterpiece
The most underrated rock album of all time
Animals indeed
"Dogs" is Enough Reason to Buy this Album
Incredible, Essential
Contrasting to other Pink Floyd works
There may be dogs about
Extremely Underrated Floyd Effort
Deliciously cynical social commentary, the Wall was merely a Logical Progression from this dark masterpiece
The last REAL Pink Floyd album
Arguably my favorite Floyd album...
Underrated
One of Floyd's greatest achievements
Pretty Good
animals
Animals is more agressive.
Roger Waters thinks you have fleas
Floyd's Overlooked Masterpiece
The best album they ever did
Vitriol tempered with redemption: The Floyd smell the coffee
One of the Floyd's best albums
Forget The Wall, this is Pink Floyd's best
Squeal like a Piggie!
ITS JUST SOOOO GOOOOOD!  YAAAASSSSS!
The Ultimate Denunciation of Society!
Animals Exposes Humanity In All Its Ugliness And Carnality
Roger Waters begins to take on the world
Perhaps the most overlooked in Pink Floyd's catalogue
An original and interesting album
genius
Strange and dark, yet reflective and rewarding
Bitter, depressing, cynical and magnificent
Musically it is epic, lyrically it is brilliant.

A change in sound but still brilliantly Floyd

Deserves more praise than it first got
Stunning. A timeless gem.  Societies crucible set to music.
A vastly underrated masterwork
Get out of the road if you want to grow old
They were never better than here
Oh my.  Roger's mad about something.
Seems like yesterday...
